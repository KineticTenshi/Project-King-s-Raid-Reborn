# Project: King's Raid Reborn

An amateur attempt to revive *King's Raid*, a beloved side-scrolling RPG, by recreating its core mechanics and systems within the Unity engine.

## Overview

This project aims to rebuild key gameplay elements of *King's Raid*, including:

- Character classes and abilities
- Combat systems

The goal is to faithfully replicate the original game's experience while allowing for future enhancements and customizations.

## Progress

- Heroes/monsters stats are implemented for the most part. Transcendance system is functionnal but still incomplete (missing a few T2 skills).
- Skills are well implemented and working correctly along with Light and Dark Transcendance.
- Gears and Awaekning system are functionnal. Gears can be equipped/unequipped, Runes can be added/removed, and Lines can be rerolled. Unique Weapons are functionnal, Soul Weapons are starting to get implemented.

- Currently, Clause, Kasel, Valance and Shea are implemented with functionnal Skills, Unique Weapons and some Unique Treasures.

## Repository Structure

- `Unity/` — Contains Unity-specific scripts.
- `NonUnity/` — Contains supplementary materials not directly tied to Unity.
